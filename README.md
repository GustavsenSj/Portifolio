# My portfolio site

This is my portfolio site. It's a hobby project to learn more about css animations and other stuff i might find interesting.

## Credits where credits are due

- The animated "blobs" in the background is from @LA_water link to [codepen](https://codepen.io/LA_water/pen/rNaYZBb)
- The pages uses ScollTimline and as most browser does not support this (as of 09/11/23) a polyfill is used to make it work in most browsers. The polyfill is from [Scroll-timeline Polyfill](https://github.com/flackr/scroll-timeline)
